## Completed projects

### Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

A business is delivering coupons to drivers for food-related establishments in their proximity. Our goal for this study is to determine the factors that affect the coupon acceptance rate. We use a number of different techniques, including exploratory data analysis and statistical tests, in our analysis.

### Practical Application Assignment 11.1: What Drives the Price of a Car?

The used car market is one of the largest in the world. Used cars are in high demand because they are typically sold at discounted prices while remaining usable.

In this exercise, a used car dealership wishes to develop a model using the [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) methodology to analyze used car sales. We develop and analyze a model to provide insights on how it could make a business more profitable.
